    "In Python, an exception is an abnormal or unexpected event that occurs during the execution of a program. Exceptions are raised when an error or problem is encountered in the code, and they disrupt the normal flow of the program. When an exception is raised, Python will look for an exception handler (a block of code that can handle the exception) to handle the situation gracefully, preventing the program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Division by zero.\n",
    "    2. Trying to access an index that is out of range in a list or tuple.\n",
    "    3. Attempting to open a file that doesn't exist.\n",
    "    4. Calling a function or method with the wrong number or type of arguments.\n",
    "    5. Attempting to perform an invalid operation on data\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Exceptions occur during the runtime of a program.\n",
    "2. They are raised when the program encounters an issue while executing a statement or block of code.\n",
    "3. Exceptions can be handled using try...except blocks, allowing the program to gracefully recover from the error.\n",
    "4. Examples of exceptions include \"ZeroDivisionError,\" \"IndexError,\" \"FileNotFoundError,\" and \"TypeError.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Syntax errors occur during the parsing (compilation) of the code before it is executed.\n",
    "2. They are typically caused by violating the rules of the Python language, such as incorrect indentation, missing or misplaced punctuation, or invalid keywords.\n",
    "3. Syntax errors prevent the program from running and must be fixed before the code can be executed.\n",
    "4. Examples of syntax errors include missing colons in loops or functions, using undefined variables, or mismatched parentheses."
